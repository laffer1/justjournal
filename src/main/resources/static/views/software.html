<h2>Software</h2>

<p class="firstone">There are two different methods for updating your journal. You
    can either post entries via this website or using one of the desktop clients. In order
    to use one of the desktop clients, you must download and install the program on your computer.
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The Windows client sits in the
    taskbar when its running and allows you to quickly post entries throughout the day. It also allows
    you to auto-detect the music playing on your computer.
    You can even use the Microsoft Word spell checker if Word is installed. The website
    version works from any computer, pda or other device with a web browser that can
    view normal HTML webpages.</p>
