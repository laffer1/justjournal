<h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide
    this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you
    can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this
    notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point
    where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>

<h3>The Information We Collect:</h3>

<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the JustJournal.com
    website. On some pages, you can create accounts, post publicly accesible
    journal entries and comments, and post other personal information. The types
    of personal information collected at these pages are:</p>

<p>First Name<br/>

    Partial Address including State, Zip Code and Country<br/>
    Email addresses<br/>
    Phone number<br/>
    Instant Messaging usernames<br/>
    usernames nad passwords used on this site<br/>
    personal diary &amp; journal entries for public viewing</p>

<h3>The Way We Use Information:</h3>

<p>We use the information you provide about yourself to maintain your account.
    It may be used to contact you through e-mail about site announcements, password
    resets, and abuses.</p>

<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses
    are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>

<p>You can register with our website if you would like to post publicly accesible
    journal entries or comments. In addition, journal entries marked private
    or friends only security will be protected to the best of our ability. It
    is possible through a failure or glitch in our software that this information
    could be viewable to other parties. We do not encrypt journal entries stored
    on our system, and if unauthorized access into our system could put your
    information at risk. Security measures are in place to prevent such occurances
    when possible. (including software patches, firewalls, antivirus, and file
    integrity software)</p>

<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website
    and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that

    X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y
    number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but
    we would
    not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. Currently,
    we do not use advertising on our site for third parties. We may change this
    policy in the future.</p>

<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided
    to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also
    providing
    you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
    (we do not sell your e-mail addresses! Spam is a serious problem, and software
    is installed on our mail servers to prevent it.)</p>

<h3>Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct
    use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
    and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect
    online. In the future we plan on adding SSL technology to this site and use
    of encryption technologies to protect sensitive information. </p>

<h3>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h3>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that
    reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those
    we actually know are under 13.</p>

<h3>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h3>

<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect
    online and maintain by visiting the preferences page.

    You will need to login with your username and password. We use this procedure
    to better safeguard your information.</p>

<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information
    by sending us a request that credibly shows error.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps
    to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
